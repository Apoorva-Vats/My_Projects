### Sales Overview Dashboard
*Tools Used Power BI| MS Excel*  
A rapidly expanding retail company is facing challenges in evaluating its performance across multiple regions as its sales and operations teams work diligently to boost revenue. Key questions remain unanswered, such as identifying the regions and states that are performing well and determining where additional resources should be strategically invested. Furthermore, the company seeks to assess the effectiveness of its strategies by analyzing year-over-year improvements or declines in performance. Another critical area of concern is understanding how seasonal or monthly trends influence their sales, which could provide valuable insights for optimizing their operations and marketing efforts [View](https://github.com/Apoorva-Vats/Sales-Overview-Dashoboard) .
